Intro
- using COVID-19 dataset (uploaded to github)
- relevant background
- "What province does a person live in if they contracted COVID-19 between (two dates), [other predictors], ...?"
    - not for sure but this is the best we've got right now (classification)
- OR predict how many people will contract covid in January 2022 based on the data provided
    - regression question (neither Jason or Mikayla know how to do this yet)
    
exploratory data analysis
- An example of a useful table could be one that reports the number of observations in each class, 
  the means of the predictor variables you plan to use in your analysis and how many rows have missing data. 
- comparison of COVID-19 rates between each province


Methods
- classification/regression analysis
- need to do a cross-validation before we know what columns to use
- visualize the results with a scatter plot


Outcomes and Significance
- we expect to find...
- Knowing these results can help minimize the damage done by COVID-19 and help predict when it will be safe to relax restrictions
- will these trends observed in the data set continue into 2022 or will there be a large change?
