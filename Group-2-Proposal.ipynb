    "- #####Warning message:\n",
    "“Too little data to stratify.\n",
    "• Resampling will be unstratified.”\n",
    "- ##### underfitting? (look at our accuracy vs k)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Identified NA values, but did not do anything to deal with them. For example, since so many NA values are within the numprob column, this column can be removed and thus all NA values will be gone as well (current code causes NA by coercion error).\n",
    "    - fix: remove numprob column, filter out NA\n",
    "    - fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Work is not reproducible (data is read from local directory as opposed to remote source).Did not use set.seed() when doing initial.split (this also causes non-reproducibility since it will make different splits each time).\n",
    "    - fix: set a seed\n",
    "    - fixed, set.seed(100)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Why set options(repr.matrix.max.rows = 6) for the first few tables when it's causing the data you're trying to display  to get cut off?\n",
    "    - fix: row = 13\n",
    "    - fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "- #####  Proposal lacks justification for choice of predictors - a lot of these predictors boil down to population size and testing capacity.\n",

    "    - We can remove some population predictors:number confirmed, number probable, number of deaths, total number, keep:date,percent recovered (split date)\n",
    "    - fixed\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### This dataset requires more exploratory analysis to determine coverage over time for different provinces and the distribution of predictor statistics by province. If the difference in number probable, number of deaths, total number, and number confirmed is consistent between provinces, then perhaps it only makes sense to use one of these?\n",
    "    -  we can do date v.s. percent recovered for the provinces, distribution of predictor statistics by province (idk how?). We might want to keep one of these population based predictors as suggested in addition to time and percent recovered (mabe use number of confirmed to show testing capability of healthcare system).\n",
    "    - later\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Be careful with the 'too little data to stratify error'. This means that one of the classes might have too few data points in each class to stratify. \n",
    "  -  see if this still shows up after we remove numprob column, is it still show up we remove Nunavut\n",
    "  - not fixed !!! removing colomns and Nunauvut did not help, I think the only way to fix this is to use another dataset ot colomns other than % recovered?\n",
    "  - (Mikayla) Fixed this problem by removing the territories (Nunavut, Yukon and Northwest Territories)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ##### Need to explain insights from summary table. Now that you have calculated the means of each column, what can you derive from that? \n",
    "  -  I thought we did...? Mabe write a new paragraph for summary table (since now we only explained it with graph)\n",
    "  - later\n",
    " \n",
    "- ##### Writing: Note that you've significantly exceeded the word count. I recommend doing your best to adhere to the limit in the final report submission.\n",
    "  -  Final work count is 2000, we should check Rubric before submission \n",
    "- ##### For choosing K, (Jason) asked to TA: He said that we need to start setting K as 2, and increase K by 1 until K = 5 to find the best fitted k. \n",

    "COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (Government of Canada). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, on December 12th 2019 (CDC Museum Covid-19 Timeline). The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic. The common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, headache, loss of smell and taste(Government of Canada). Canada is also severely impacted by COVID-19. Although there are a number of available vaccines and treatments, there were nearly 4,300,000 infected people by the end of September, 2022 . Ontario has the highest total number of infected people, nearly 1,470,000, however, the total number of infected people in Nunavut is just 3531. (Government of Canada) Because the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are the closest to the Arctic Circle, there are not as many people living there as other 10 provinces, which causes a huge difference in the number of the total infected people per province/territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we want to predict which Canadian province best describes a territorial health report which has the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a particular month of the year. In order to do so we will investigate public health information gathered from different Canadian territories since the start of the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we work on in this project is taken from https://health-infobase.canada.ca/ (health info base of Government of Canada) based on data that provincial and territorial partners published on cases and deaths. This data contains daily information of COVID-19 cases from January 2020 until December 2021. There are 7 important properties we want to choose as our classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. province : Canada province/territory (P/T) from which the information was reported, containing names of 13 Canadian provinces and territories.\n",
    "2. date : Date of recorded observation\n",
    "3. numconf : Number of confirmed cases in each P/T (Canada= sum of all P/T)\n",
    "4. numprob : Number of probable cases in each P/T (Canada= sum of all P/T)\n",
    "5. numdeaths : Number of deaths in each P/T (Canada= sum of all P/T)\n",
    "6. numtotal : Total number of cases, calculated by number of confirmed cases plus number of probable cases.\n",
    "7. Percentrecover : Percentage of recovered cases, Calculated by the number of recovered cases for P/T divided by the total number of confirmed cases for that P/T [(numrecover/numtotal) * 100]\n",

    "### Expected Outcomes and Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be building a Knn classification model that predicts province name based on date, number of confirmed cases, number of probable cases, number of deaths, total number of cases and  percentage of recovered cases. We believe that these predictors (except for date) are a unique feature of each province which is a result of its province demographics, COVID policies and medical system. For example, in our visualization, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador have the same highest recovery rate. We believe that the Maritime provinces (Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, PEI, New Brunswick) will have the highest COVID-19 recovery rates because They have a smaller population and likely have a healthcare system that will not be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the initial stage of proposing our project, from the relationship between average percent recovered and province, we can observe a difference in recovery rate that varies across provinces. This made us wonder what is contributing to this difference? Province demographics, COVID policies and medical system can all lead to the kind of differences between provinces that is displayed in a relationship like recovery rate. More specifically, population density, mask mandate and tester kit provision could contribute to the number of confirmed cases, probable cases and total number of cases in a particular province. Number of deaths, for example, would increase if the demographic of the population appears to be more aged. The efficiency and capacity of the medical system on the other hand can lead to differences in average percent recovered across provinces. We could gain a grasp of whether or not our speculation of “characteristic of province effect covid conditions of that province” is correct if we can make accurate predictions (classify) a province based on covid conditions variables: number of confirmed cases,number of probable cases, number of deaths, total number of cases and  percentage of recovered cases. Our study can allow us to gain a grasp on whether or not the COVID situation in each province is uniquely related to its various demographical, political and infrastructural features that can help future studies to extend on which area to focus more when handling COVID-19 and identify the provinces that need more support or response strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Future questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why does Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador have the highest recovery rate? (derive a casual relationship)\n",
    "2. Does the recovery rate relate to other categorical variables that show a considerable difference between the province with highest recovery rate and others? \n",
    "3. Can the successes of such two provinces be adapted to help improve the recovery rates of other provinces given that demographic and medical system differences exist between different provinces?\n",
    "4. How can we make a decision about what percent of weight does every predictor account for?\n"
